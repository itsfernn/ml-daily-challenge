# ðŸ§  Daily Machine Learning Challenge

Welcome to my **Daily Machine Learning Challenge**; a personal commitment to sharpen my machine learning skills by tackling one concept, algorithm, or problem **every day**.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Build intuition through daily practice
- Cover both classic ML and deep learning topics
- Implement models from scratch and using libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- Explore real-world datasets and tasks
- Learn something new every single day

---

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

Each day is organized into a separate folder:

``` 
daily-ml/
â”œâ”€â”€ day01-linear-regression/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ notebook.ipynb
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ day02-logistic-regression/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ...
...
``` 


Each folder includes:
- A Jupyter notebook or script
- A brief explanation of the concept
- Key takeaways and notes

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (as needed)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
